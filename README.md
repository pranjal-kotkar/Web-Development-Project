Existing System
The current Training and Placement management system in our institution is facing several challenges:

1.Sorting Problem
Data is maintained in Excel sheets, where sorting large amounts of data becomes problematic and inefficient.

2.Search Problem
Due to improper organization of files, it becomes difficult and time-consuming to search for specific information.

3.Replica of Files
Manual data handling increases the chances of file duplication, leading to confusion and inconsistency.

4.More Manual Work
All processes are carried out manually by the Training and Placement Officer (TPO), which increases workload.

5.Human Error
Manual work significantly increases the chances of error due to human intervention.

6.Time Consuming
The inefficiencies mentioned above result in a slower and more time-consuming process.

7.Traffic Problem
When multiple people access the shared Excel sheets, it can cause performance issues or even lead to file failures.

These challenges highlight the need for a more efficient, automated, and user-friendly system to manage training and placement activities.
The proposed solution aims to resolve these issues by leveraging modern technologies to:

1.Streamline processes

2.Minimize manual effort

3.Reduce errors

4.Enhance data accessibility and accuracy
